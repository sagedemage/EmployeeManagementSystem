        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of the project is to learn how to connect back-end framework with a front-end framework which
            does not use Node.js. I was inspired to use front-end framework without Node.js from a company I worked for in 
            my Capstone class. I won't mention the company for confidentiality reasons.
        </p>
        <p>This project uses two technologies:
            <ul>
                <li>Spring Boot</li>
                <li>Vue.js without Node.js</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
